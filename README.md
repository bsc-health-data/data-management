# Data management

Research data management refers to the handling of research data (collection, organisation, storage, and documentation) during and after a research activity. Good data management helps ensure that researchers share their data in a FAIR way (findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable). Research organisations increasingly require their researchers to develop a data management plan to ensure that all aspects are considered from the start of an activity on.
